* Notes

This is an [[https://orgmode.org/][org-mode]] [[https://leanpub.com/lit-config][literate config]].
From Emacs, you can use <TAB> to expand sections. Emacs lisp in =src= blocks gets /tangled/ (exported).

To tangle this file, run =org-babel-tangle= (C-c C-v t).

* Doom config file overview

Doom Emacs uses three config files:

- =init.el= defines which of the existing Doom [[https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs/blob/master/docs/getting_started.org#modules][modules]] are loaded. A Doom module is a bundle of packages, configuration and commands, organized into a unit that can be toggled easily from this file.
- =packages.el= defines which [[https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs/blob/master/docs/getting_started.org#package-management][packages]] should be installed, beyond those that are installed and loaded as part of the enabled modules.
- =config.el= contains all [[https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs/blob/master/docs/getting_started.org#configuring-doom][custom configuration]] and code.

There are other files that can be loaded, but theses are the main ones. The load order of different files is [[https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs/blob/develop/docs/getting_started.org#load-order][defined depending on the type of session]] being started.

All the config files are generated from this Org file, to try and make its meaning as clear as possible. All =package!= declarations are written to =packages.el=, all other LISP code is written to =config.el=.

** Config file headers

We start by simply defining the standard headers used by the three files. These headers come from the initial files generated by =doom install=, and contain either some Emacs-LISP relevant indicators like =lexical-binding=, or instructions about the contents of the file.

;; DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE DIRECTLY
;; This is a file generated from a literate programming source file located at
;; https://github.com/mattmc3/doom.d/blob/main/doom.org
;; You should make any changes there and regenerate it from Emacs org-mode
;; using org-babel-tangle (C-c C-v t).

;; This file controls what Doom modules are enabled and what order they load
;; in. Remember to run 'doom sync' after modifying it!

;; NOTE Press 'SPC h d h' (or 'C-h d h' for non-vim users) to access Doom's
;;      documentation. There you'll find a link to Doom's Module Index where all
;;      of our modules are listed, including what flags they support.

;; NOTE Move your cursor over a module's name (or its flags) and press 'K' (or
;;      'C-c c k' for non-vim users) to view its documentation. This works on
;;      flags as well (those symbols that start with a plus).
;;
;;      Alternatively, press 'gd' (or 'C-c c d') on a module to browse its
;;      directory (for easy access to its source code).

;; DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE DIRECTLY
;; This is a file generated from a literate programming source file located at
;; https://github.com/mattmc3/doom.d/blob/main/doom.org
;; You should make any changes there and regenerate it from Emacs org-mode
;; using org-babel-tangle (C-c C-v t).

;; To install a package with Doom you must declare them here and run 'doom sync'
;; on the command line, then restart Emacs for the changes to take effect -- or
;; use 'M-x doom/reload'.


;; To install SOME-PACKAGE from MELPA, ELPA or emacsmirror:
;(package! some-package)

;; To install a package directly from a remote git repo, you must specify a
;; `:recipe'. You'll find documentation on what `:recipe' accepts here:
;; https://github.com/radian-software/straight.el#the-recipe-format
;(package! another-package
;  :recipe (:host github :repo "username/repo"))

;; If the package you are trying to install does not contain a PACKAGENAME.el
;; file, or is located in a subdirectory of the repo, you'll need to specify
;; `:files' in the `:recipe':
;(package! this-package
;  :recipe (:host github :repo "username/repo"
;           :files ("some-file.el" "src/lisp/*.el")))

;; If you'd like to disable a package included with Doom, you can do so here
;; with the `:disable' property:
;(package! builtin-package :disable t)

;; You can override the recipe of a built in package without having to specify
;; all the properties for `:recipe'. These will inherit the rest of its recipe
;; from Doom or MELPA/ELPA/Emacsmirror:
;(package! builtin-package :recipe (:nonrecursive t))
;(package! builtin-package-2 :recipe (:repo "myfork/package"))

;; Specify a `:branch' to install a package from a particular branch or tag.
;; This is required for some packages whose default branch isn't 'master' (which
;; our package manager can't deal with; see radian-software/straight.el#279)
;(package! builtin-package :recipe (:branch "develop"))

;; Use `:pin' to specify a particular commit to install.
;(package! builtin-package :pin "1a2b3c4d5e")


;; Doom's packages are pinned to a specific commit and updated from release to
;; release. The `unpin!' macro allows you to unpin single packages...
;(unpin! pinned-package)
;; ...or multiple packages
;(unpin! pinned-package another-pinned-package)
;; ...Or *all* packages (NOT RECOMMENDED; will likely break things)
;(unpin! t)

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle config.el
;;; $DOOMDIR/config.el -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;; DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE DIRECTLY
;; This is a file generated from a literate programming source file located at
;; https://github.com/mattmc3/doom.d/blob/main/doom.org
;; You should make any changes there and regenerate it from Emacs org-mode
;; using org-babel-tangle (C-c C-v t).

;; Place your private configuration here! Remember, you do not need to run 'doom
;; sync' after modifying this file!


;; Some functionality uses this to identify you, e.g. GPG configuration, email
;; clients, file templates and snippets. It is optional.
;; (setq user-full-name "John Doe"
;;       user-mail-address "john@doe.com")

;; Doom exposes five (optional) variables for controlling fonts in Doom:
;;
;; - `doom-font' -- the primary font to use
;; - `doom-variable-pitch-font' -- a non-monospace font (where applicable)
;; - `doom-big-font' -- used for `doom-big-font-mode'; use this for
;;   presentations or streaming.
;; - `doom-unicode-font' -- for unicode glyphs
;; - `doom-serif-font' -- for the `fixed-pitch-serif' face
;;
;; See 'C-h v doom-font' for documentation and more examples of what they
;; accept. For example:
;;
;; (setq doom-font (font-spec :family "Fira Code" :size 12 :weight 'semi-light)
;;       doom-variable-pitch-font (font-spec :family "Fira Sans" :size 13))
;;
;; If you or Emacs can't find your font, use 'M-x describe-font' to look them
;; up, `M-x eval-region' to execute elisp code, and 'M-x doom/reload-font' to
;; refresh your font settings. If Emacs still can't find your font, it likely
;; wasn't installed correctly. Font issues are rarely Doom issues!

;; There are two ways to load a theme. Both assume the theme is installed and
;; available. You can either set `doom-theme' or manually load a theme with the
;; `load-theme' function. This is the default:
;; (setq doom-theme 'doom-one)

;; This determines the style of line numbers in effect. If set to `nil', line
;; numbers are disabled. For relative line numbers, set this to `relative'.
;; (setq display-line-numbers-type t)

;; If you use `org' and don't want your org files in the default location below,
;; change `org-directory'. It must be set before org loads!
;; (setq org-directory "~/org/")


;; Whenever you reconfigure a package, make sure to wrap your config in an
;; `after!' block, otherwise Doom's defaults may override your settings. E.g.
;;
;;   (after! PACKAGE
;;     (setq x y))
;;
;; The exceptions to this rule:
;;
;;   - Setting file/directory variables (like `org-directory')
;;   - Setting variables which explicitly tell you to set them before their
;;     package is loaded (see 'C-h v VARIABLE' to look up their documentation).
;;   - Setting doom variables (which start with 'doom-' or '+').
;;
;; Here are some additional functions/macros that will help you configure Doom.
;;
;; - `load!' for loading external *.el files relative to this one
;; - `use-package!' for configuring packages
;; - `after!' for running code after a package has loaded
;; - `add-load-path!' for adding directories to the `load-path', relative to
;;   this file. Emacs searches the `load-path' when you load packages with
;;   `require' or `use-package'.
;; - `map!' for binding new keys
;;
;; To get information about any of these functions/macros, move the cursor over
;; the highlighted symbol at press 'K' (non-evil users must press 'C-c c k').
;; This will open documentation for it, including demos of how they are used.
;; Alternatively, use `C-h o' to look up a symbol (functions, variables, faces,
;; etc).
;;
;; You can also try 'gd' (or 'C-c c d') to jump to their definition and see how
;; they are implemented.

* Look-and-feel

** Theme

There are two ways to load a theme. Both assume the theme is installed and available. You can either set =doom-theme= or manually load a theme with the =load-theme= function.

I like the default Doom themes, so let's start with that.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq doom-theme 'doom-one)
#+end_src

** Font

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; Set the font
;; On a Mac, fonts can be found in the FontBook app
(ignore-errors (set-frame-font "MesloLGL Nerd Font 14"))
#+end_src

** Cursor

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; Make the cursor a bar, not a blinking box
(setq-default cursor-type 'bar)
#+end_src

* Editor

** Line numbers

This determines the style of line numbers in effect. If set to =nil=, line numbers are disabled. For relative line numbers, set this to =relative=.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; line numbers
(global-display-line-numbers-mode)
(setq display-line-numbers-type 'relative)
#+end_src

** Splash screen

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; hide splash screen
;; (setq inhibit-splash-screen t)
#+end_src

** Scratch buffer

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; empty *scratch*
;; (setq initial-scratch-message "")
#+end_src

* Features

** desktop

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; desktop save mode (session restore)
(setq desktop-save t)
(desktop-save-mode 1)
#+end_src

** Highlight

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; highlight the current line
(global-hl-line-mode +1)
#+end_src

** recentf

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; recent files
(recentf-mode 1)
(setq recentf-max-menu-items 25)
(global-set-key "\C-x\ \C-r" 'recentf-open-files)
#+end_src

** Tab bar

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; show tab bar (er... don't actually show it and use ui: tabs per doom docs)
;; (global-tab-line-mode t)
#+end_src

** Confirm Quit Emacs

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; don't confirm when emacs exits
(setq confirm-kill-emacs nil)
#+end_src

** Whitespace

Trailing newlines:

** org-mode

Set the default location of org files.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-directory "~/Documents/org/")
#+end_src

Tangle-on-save automatically runs =org-babel-tangle= upon saving any org-mode buffer, which means the resulting files will be automatically kept up to date. The [[https://github.com/yilkalargaw/org-auto-tangle][org-auto-tangle]] package does this asynchronously and selectively for each Org file where it is desired.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle packages.el
(package! org-auto-tangle)
#+end_src
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package! org-auto-tangle
  :defer t
  :hook (org-mode . org-auto-tangle-mode)

* Keybindings

We gotta move/organize these, but here they are for now:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;;; Keybindings

;; In the old days ESC was used as a prefix key, but I want ESC to act like it
;; does everywhere else on my system and, you know, escape from things. So
;; I've remapped ESC to `keyboard-quit'.
